# Terrain
### Created by Tadzio Cancilla, 2020

This is a project mainly created to test my ability to create games.
It is my first major project created in Unity using the programming language C#.

As it should be obvious, inspiration comes from Terraria and Minecraft. This project will most likely never be totally finished, however I am going to try my best to work on this.
